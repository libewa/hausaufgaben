# Contributers guide to libewa/hausaufgaben

# Branches
The `main` branch shows the code of the current "stable" version. `beta` is used for building the TestFlight beta. `dev` is where the development happens. That branch is officially unstable and should NEVER! be used in production environments. All branches should stem from `dev` and work on a simulated or real device (not the Assistant Editor).

6. Open a pull request and answer questions that people might ask
