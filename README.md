hausaufgaben (homework in german) is an app to note down homework. It uses CoreData to store the homework list.

The app is made of 100% organically produced SwiftUI.
I am welcome to feature requests and community bugfixes. Look at the [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for a list of labels and their purposes.

## CloudKit
I have now decided against CloudKit, because some users may lose their data and someone is definitly gonna sue us for not having a proper privacy policy. Also we would have to make a yearly report of what things we encrypted with what algorithms. It's just not worth the hassle.

## Downloads

### App Store

Will be available once the TestFlight runs well.

### TestFlight
https://testflight.apple.com/join/nopmEm9m

The App is still not in a full release state and should not be used without backup alternatives.
