# hausaufgaben

hausaufgaben (homework in german) is an app to note down homework. It uses CoreData to store the homework list and will maybe be expanded to use CloudKit.

The app is made of 100% organically produced SwiftUI.
I am welcome to feature requests and help with the bug `UnsafeRawBufferPointer with negative count` that is thrown once I run the app on the simulator.
